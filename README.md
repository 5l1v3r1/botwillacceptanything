# Nomic

### An autotonomous program that accepts pull requests for itself

>Nomic is a program in which changing its own code is its primary function. In that respect it differs from almost every other program. Nomic outsources to humans the work of proposing changes to the code, debating the wisdom of changing it in that way, voting on the changes, and merging them into master. Even this core of the program, of course, can be changed.

Each pull request on this repo is voted on by the community. If the vote passes, the Nomic server will update itself to the new version. Any part of the code can be changed (including the voting system), as long as the community votes for it.

Nomic is an example of an **autonomous organization**. No human is in direct control. Unlike normal human organizations, Nomic is incorruptible and only operates on a formal set of rules.
