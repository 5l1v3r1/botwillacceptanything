# Nomic

### *An autonomous program that accepts pull requests for itself*

>Nomic is a program in which changing its own code is its primary function. In that respect it differs from almost all other software. Nomic outsources to humans the work of proposing changes to the code, debating the wisdom of changing it in that way, voting on the changes, and merging them into master. Even this core of the program, of course, can be changed.

Each pull request on this repo is voted on by the community. If the vote passes, the Nomic server will update itself to the new version. Any part of the code can be changed (including the voting system), as long as the community votes for it.

## Getting Started

* View the [open Pull Requests](https://github.com/nomic-io/nomic/pulls) to see what changes have been proposed
* :star: **Star the repo**, or else your votes won't get counted
* On a pull request thread, comment with `:+1:` (:+1:) to vote for the PR to pass, or `:-1:` (:-1:) to vote against the PR

If you want to propose a change, just submit a pull request like you would to any other repo!

## What kinds of changes will be made?

Some possible changes people might submit are:

* A score system, so authors of pull requests can be rewarded
* Tweaks to the voting algorithm to prevent Nomic from accepting malicious changes
* Code that randomly changes the @nomic-io Github password, so no human has access to the account
* Adding a Bitcoin wallet so Nomic can earn money, then paying out rewards to authors of pull requests
* Selling Nomic shares, so voting power is held by people with financial stake in Nomic

This project is intended to be an experiment in the area of autonomous aoftware (which includes things like Decentralized Autonomous Corporations (DACs), which is what [the Ethereum project](https://www.ethereum.org) wants to enable). The direction will be decided by the community, and the future of Nomic is largely undefined.

Nomic is an example of **autonomous software**. No human is in direct control. Unlike normal human organizations and entities, Nomic is incorruptible and only operates on a formal set of rules (defined by the code).
